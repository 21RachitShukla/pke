Code documentation of ``pke``
=============================

``pke`` is an open source python-based keyphrase extraction toolkit. It provides
an end-to-end keyphrase extraction pipeline in which each component can be
easily modified or extented to develop new approaches. ``pke`` also allows for 
easy benchmarking of state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction approaches, and 
ships with supervised models trained on the `SemEval-2010 dataset
<http://aclweb.org/anthology/S10-1004.pdf>`_.
